# Work in Progress

A simple web application that performs conversions of measurements or units.
Proposed measurements are Length, Temperature, and Weight.

Majority of the code will be in Python. The web application will be built using Django.

Another repo will house the CI/CD or deployment process. This is an attempt at going serverless.

## I hope this isn't another tech debt that I'll convert to "private" then go on with my life ðŸ˜©
